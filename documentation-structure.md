# Documentation structure

This documentation is mainly structured based on the [building blocks as defined in the Data Spaces Blueprint 2.0 by Data Spaces Support Centre](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071251457/Data+Spaces+Blueprint+v2.0+-+Home), which are based on the [Open DEI project](https://design-principles-for-data-spaces.org/). Building blocks are basic units or components that can be implemented and combined with other building blocks to achieve the functionality of a data space.

[Business and Organisational Building Blocks](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071252613): These address key capabilities needed in three sub-areas:
- Business: The business model of the GDDS and its participants, the development of use cases, the role of intermediaries and operators of services and the concept of a data space offering.
- Governance: The organisational form of the GDDS initiative, the governance processes and the management of participants.
- Legal: The required contractual framework between participants and regulatory compliance. 

[Technical Building Blocks](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071254703): These address the key capabilities on a technical level. They are also subdivided into three categories:
-Data Interoperability: Specifying domain models/semantics, technical interfaces for data exchange and approaches for provenance & traceability.
-Data Sovereignty & Trust: Enabling the identification of participants, verifying compliance and specifying and enforcing data access and usage policies.
-Data Value Creation Enablers: Describing and publishing of data products and making them findable for others (e.g. in a catalogue), as well as introducing additional services for value-creation in your data space

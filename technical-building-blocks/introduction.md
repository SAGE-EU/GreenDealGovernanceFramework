# Introduction

Technical capabilities are needed to implement data spaces. The objective of the technical building blocks is to identify these capabilities and to provide standard specifications for each of them. This allows data space governance authorities and participants to make technical choices in an informed way. Furthermore, we identify common standards and specifications for most building blocks. Using these standards and specifications makes it easier to reuse technical solutions. It also becomes easier to achieve interoperability on a technical level.

## Services for implementing technical building blocks <a href="#id-4.-services-for-implementing-technical-building-blocks" id="id-4.-services-for-implementing-technical-building-blocks"></a>

These technical building blocks do not relate 1:1 to software:

* Technical building blocks provide the scope, specifications and standards for certain technical capabilities needed in a data space.
* Services are needed to implement these capabilities. Typically, these are contracted by participants in a data space and provided by a [service provider](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253470).
* Software components are needed to realise those services.

We identify three categories of services:

* Some services are needed for individual actors to join a data space. We call these participant agent services.
* Other services are needed to facilitate the interplay of participants. We call these federation services.
* Value creation services are all other services needed for data space participants to create value out of the exchanged data, such as AI algorithms or visualisation services.

[In this section, you can find the categorisation of services](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071254998) and a detailed explanation of each of them.

In the [DSSC Toolbox, ](https://toolbox.dssc.eu/)there are software components that implement one or more services.

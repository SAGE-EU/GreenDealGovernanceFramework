# Introduction to the Green Deal Data Space

## SAGE: The Data Space for a Sustainable Green Europe

SAGE will establish a fully operational **Green Deal Data Space (GDDS)** aimed at enhancing the accessibility, integration, and utilisation of green and environmental data across the EU to support key pillars of the European Green Deal—**Zero Pollution, Climate Adaptation, Biodiversity,** and the **Circular Economy Action Plan**.

Building directly upon the GDDS GREAT project community and results, and aligning with the **Digital Europe Programme's** strategic focus on AI, cybersecurity, advanced computing, and data infrastructure, SAGE leverages outcomes from the **European Strategy for Data and Research** facilitated by Horizon Europe.

SAGE's outcomes include:
- Seamlessly integrating fragmented environmental data through federation  
- Enriching data with consistent quality, validation, and interoperable metadata  
- Enhancing capabilities for data transformation, processing, analysis, forecasting, target setting, and performance monitoring  

Targeting:
- Businesses seeking compliance with EGD regulations  
- Government bodies optimising environmental impact  
- Citizens and citizen scientists engaging in environmental stewardship  
- Researchers aiming to deepen ecological understanding  

SAGE aspires to foster **informed decision-making and policy formulation** based on robust data and evidence. Its sustainability will be ensured by establishing a **standalone legal entity** to manage the data space and scale operations throughout the project's lifetime and beyond.

## SAGE: Green Deal Data Space Template

The **SAGE Green Deal Data Space Template** is a foundational framework developed to support the design, deployment, and governance of data spaces aligned with the European Green Deal objectives. It serves as a **reference architecture** and **operational model** to guide stakeholders in building interoperable, secure, and trustworthy data ecosystems that facilitate:
- Sustainable innovation  
- Data sovereignty  
- Cross-sector collaboration  

Developed within the context of the SAGE initiative, the template leverages key building blocks from the **Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC)**. It addresses critical aspects such as:
- Governance  
- Business models  
- Technical interoperability  
- Legal compliance  

This provides practical guidance for both public and private organisations engaging in environmental data sharing.

## Purpose of This Gitbook Page

This Gitbook page provides an overview of:
- The template’s structure  
- Its core components  
- How it can be customised to support specific Green Deal-related use cases  

Whether you're a **policymaker, data space architect, or solution provider**, this resource aims to accelerate the responsible creation of impactful data spaces that contribute to **Europe’s green transition**.

# Value Added Services

One of the core objectives of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS) is to ensure that shared data leads to meaningful value for participants and society. Beyond technical interoperability and trust, the GDDS must create an ecosystem where stakeholders can easily discover, access, and combine data with services to generate impact.

The Value Creation Services building block provides the technical and governance foundations to enable this. It ensures that data providers and service developers can clearly describe and publish their offerings, that potential users can easily find and evaluate them, and that mechanisms exist to support added-value services (analytics, reporting, applications) aligned with the Green Deal objectives.

This building block therefore sets the conditions for innovation, reusability, and sustainable growth within the GDDS by making offerings transparent, discoverable, and usable under agreed standards.

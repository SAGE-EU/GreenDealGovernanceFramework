# Publication & Discovery

The Publication & Discovery building block enables providers of data and services to expose their offerings (with metadata, terms, and access conditions) and make them visible to other data space participants. Consumers, in turn, use this capability to search, identify, and request access to offerings that best fit their needs.

In the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS), this capability is central for creating transparency and trust between stakeholders. It ensures that:
- Providers can effectively showcase datasets, services, and tools.
- Consumers can discover offerings aligned with their technical, legal, and sustainability needs.
- The catalogue mechanism (centralised, decentralised, or hybrid) balances openness with controlled access, reflecting governance rules.

It directly contributes to Article 33 of the EU Data Act (interoperability, discoverability, and accessibility of data spaces).

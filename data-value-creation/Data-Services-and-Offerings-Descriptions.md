# Data, Services & Offerings Descriptions

A foundational step toward value creation in the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS) is ensuring that data, services, and offerings are described in a clear, standardised, and machine-readable manner. Without a common way of expressing what is available in the data space, participants cannot efficiently discover, compare, or reuse resources.

This building block provides the tools and methodologies for consistent and transparent descriptions. It enables data providers and service operators to publish offerings in a way that is not only understandable to humans, but also interoperable for automated discovery and integration across systems and Member States.

For GDDS, these descriptions carry an additional responsibility: they must reflect sustainability-related attributes and policies. For example, datasets may need to include metadata about their relevance to COâ‚‚ reduction, energy efficiency, circular economy practices, or compliance with environmental reporting regulations. Services and tools should also be described with sufficient detail to demonstrate their contribution to Green Deal objectives.

The scope of this building block includes:
- Standardised Metadata Models: Adoption of common vocabularies, ontologies, and schemas that make data and services understandable across domains.
- Policy-Aware Descriptions: Integration of usage conditions, data-sharing rules, and sustainability-related criteria into offering descriptions.
- Machine-Readability: Ensuring that descriptions are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and support automation in publication and discovery processes.
- Sector-Specific Extensions: Where relevant, additional descriptors are introduced to reflect the unique requirements of sustainability use cases, such as emissions tracking, lifecycle analysis, or resource efficiency.

By implementing harmonised description mechanisms, GDDS ensures that participants have full visibility into the ecosystem of available resources. This not only facilitates efficient data sharing, but also accelerates the creation of innovative services, business models, and collaborative projects aligned with the EU Green Deal.

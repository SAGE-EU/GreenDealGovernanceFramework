# Data Sovereignty and Trust

Data Sovereignty and Trust building blocks give technical enablers the ability to guarantee the reliability and authenticity of participants' information while allowing participants to exercise sovereignty over the data they share. This is essential for establishing trust among participants when interacting and performing data transactions.

The Data Sovereignty and Trust pillar consists of the three following building blocks:

* [Identity and Attestation Management](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071255737): The management of identities and attestations within a data space to ensure the reliability and integrity of participants' information.
* [Trust Framework](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071255941): Verification that a participant in a data space adheres to certain rules and a common set of standards.
* [Access and Usage Policies Enforcement](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071256095): The ability to specify policies and rules within a given data space by the data space authority and the individual participants.

Access and Usage Policies Enforcement, Identity and Attestation Management, and Trust Framework are all integral components in the governance and management of data spaces. They jointly contribute to establishing a secure and reliable environment for data interactions among the participants of a data space.

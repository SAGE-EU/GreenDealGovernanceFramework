# Identity & Attestation Management

The Identity & Attestation Management building block provides the trusted foundation for onboarding, verifying, and maintaining participants’ credentials within the GDDS ecosystem.

It ensures that every actor and asset is uniquely identifiable, authenticated, and authorised before engaging in data transactions, while preserving sovereignty over identity data.

By combining machine-readable rulebooks, standardised credential formats, and secure exchange protocols, GDDS enables participants to present and verify attestations, such as membership, compliance, or sector-specific qualifications, across multiple domains and jurisdictions.

This capability is essential for:
- Trust & Compliance – Verifying that participants meet the GDDS baseline requirements and any sector-specific rules.
- Interoperability – Enabling credential federation across other recognised data spaces and trust frameworks.
- Efficiency – Reducing onboarding time and transaction costs through reusable, portable credentials.

### Core Capabilities
- Trusted Legal & Natural Person Identification – Support for both organisational and human identities, aligned with EU-recognised schemes (eIDAS, Qualified Trust Service Providers).
- Secure Credential Lifecycle Management – Issuance, renewal, revocation, and validation of credentials in compliance with GDDS governance.
- Conformity Assessment Integration – Alignment with the GDDS Rulebook and automated compliance checks.
Credential Portability & Federation – Interoperable with other ecosystems through open standards (W3C Verifiable Credentials, DIDs, OIDC4VC).
- Attestation Diversity – Support for multiple attestation types, including identity, membership, and compliance attestations.

### Design Principles
1. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) – Allow participants to control their identity attributes while meeting governance requirements.
2. Standards-First Approach – Prioritise open, widely adopted technical and governance standards.
3. Federation over Centralisation – Enable multiple trust domains to coexist with GDDS as the trust anchor.
4. Policy-Linked Identity – Ensure access and usage rights are tied to verified identities.
5. Credential Reuse – Encourage interoperability with existing compliance certifications to minimise duplication.

# Trust Framework

The Trust Framework defines the rules, roles, and mechanisms that underpin confidence in all GDDS interactions. It ensures that participants, services, and transactions can be validated against a common rulebook, making trust decisions faster, more transparent, and interoperable across sectors.

The framework serves as the connective tissue between governance requirements and technical enablers, linking identity verification, attestation management, access control, and compliance into one coherent system. By setting clear acceptance criteria for trust anchors, and trust service providers, GDDS can guarantee the authenticity, integrity, and security of both participants and the data they share.

Where possible, GDDS can adopt and extend existing trust frameworks (e.g., Gaia-X, iSHARE, IDSA) to ensure European alignment while tailoring rules to Green Deal–specific use cases.

### Core Capabilities
- Participant & Service Verification – Ensure all participants and services are verifiable against governance requirements and technical standards.

- Trust Entity Management – Define, accredit, and maintain the registry of Trust Anchors, Trust Service Providers, Conformity Assessment Bodies, and Notaries.
- Registry Integration – Store the Rulebook, accreditation lists, revoked trust entities, and compliance schemas in the GDDS registry for public reference.
- Multi-Level Trust – Define different assurance levels based on source reliability, credential type, or attestation scope.

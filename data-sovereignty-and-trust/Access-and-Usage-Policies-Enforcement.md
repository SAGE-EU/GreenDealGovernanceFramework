# Access & Usage Policies Enforcement

The Access & Usage Policies Enforcement building block defines the rules, processes, and technical mechanisms that govern how data can be accessed, used, and shared within the GDDS ecosystem. It ensures that:
- Access is granted only to authorised parties.
- Data usage follows explicitly agreed purposes and obligations.
- Consent is managed transparently and revocably.
- Compliance is verifiable and enforceable in both organisational and technical terms.

It acts as the operational layer of data sovereignty, linking identity management, trust rules, and legal agreements into actionable, machine-readable policies.

### Core Capabilities
1. Access Control Policies
- Define who can access which data and under what circumstances (role-, attribute-, or context-based).
- Enforce pre-access checks through Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) and Policy Decision Points (PDP).
2. Usage Control Policies
- Define what actions (e.g., analyse, share, modify) are permitted once access is granted.
- Apply continuous usage checks where obligations or prohibitions change over time.
3. Consent Management Policies
- Manage data subject consent and legal permissions.
- Support opt-in/opt-out and revocation workflows.
- Maintain audit trails for compliance proof.
4. Policy Transformation & Interoperability
- Translate agreements into machine-readable formats (e.g., ODRL).
- Ensure semantic interoperability between participantsâ€™ systems.
5. Compliance Tracking & Enforcement Proof
- Log and audit every access and usage event.
- Provide verifiable enforcement evidence for trust and dispute resolution.

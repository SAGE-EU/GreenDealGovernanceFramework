# Provenance and Traceability

The Provenance & Traceability building block ensures that all relevant metadata and logs, from data origin to usage, are recorded, auditable, and shareable under agreed governance rules.

It supports compliance with regulations (e.g., AI Act, GDPR, sectoral laws), contractual obligations, and business agreements, while also building trust among participants.

Two main aspects are addressed:
- Provenance (Backward-looking) – Evidence of data origin, ownership, custody, and processing history.
- Traceability (Forward-looking) – Evidence of how shared data has been used, transformed, or combined after delivery.

Observability, which is the monitoring of Control Plane activities (e.g., contract negotiation, publication/discovery), is part of this block and complements provenance and traceability for compliance and operational transparency.

### Design Principles
- Compliance-Driven – Requirements stem from legal, contractual, and business rules.
- Standards-Based – Reuse existing models (e.g., W3C PROV-O, PAV) with domain-specific extensions.
- Decentralised Where Possible – Avoid single points of control; enable participant-managed and federated observability services.
- Trust Management – Ensure that any 3rd-party observers are themselves trusted and bound by agreed policies.
- Value-Oriented – Treat provenance data as a data product, enabling value creation beyond compliance.

### Core Capabilities
1. Requirements Identification – Map regulatory, contractual, and business drivers for provenance and traceability.
2. Data Modelling – Define and publish data models for provenance and traceability; link to domain ontologies.
3. Storage & Processing – Decide on decentralised vs. centralised storage and processing; set retention policies.
4. Access & Usage Control – Apply identity and policy enforcement to provenance datasets.
5. Observability Services – Define scope, granularity, and format of monitored activities; protect observability data.
6. Audit & Certification – Enable verifiable records for compliance audits and certifications.

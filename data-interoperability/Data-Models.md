# Data Models

In the GDDS, data models are the foundation for semantic interoperability, ensuring that shared data is interpreted consistently by all participants. A data model provides the semantic “dictionary” for a data product or service, defining data elements, their relationships, and their meaning.

Using shared or compatible data models allows data providers and consumers to “speak the same language” when exchanging information. This is essential for avoiding misunderstandings, enabling automated processing, and ensuring that data from multiple sources can be combined meaningfully.

The GDDS will encourage reusing existing semantic standards where possible, extending them when needed, and creating new models only as a last resort. All models should be published in a common Vocabulary Service, making them discoverable and accessible within the GDDS, and ideally across other data spaces, using standardised formats and metadata.

### Design Considerations
- Balance between uniformity and flexibility: Uniform models help ensure data consistency, but flexibility is needed to accommodate sector-specific needs.
- Federated discoverability: Participants should be able to find and evaluate models from other domains or data spaces.
- Lifecycle governance: Models evolve; governance must ensure they remain relevant, accurate, and aligned with broader standards.

### Core Capabilities
1. Model Development – Reuse or create models to meet GDDS needs, aligning with recognised standards.
2. Model Governance – Define processes, roles, and tools for maintaining models over time.
3. Model Integration – Ensure every GDDS data offering is linked to an agreed data model.
4. Abstraction Management – Support different representation levels (vocabulary, ontology, application profile, schema) and smooth transitions to technical exchange formats.
5. Cross-Data Space Interoperability – Enable standardised discovery and reuse of models from other data spaces.

# Data Interoperability

A clear understanding of data is crucial for ensuring individuals and systems can accurately and consistently interpret and use it. This should be done both on a semantic and technical level. While semantic interoperability focuses on the meaning of concepts, technical interoperability is concerned with a specific syntax. Data spaces must identify data models and standardise the technical interfaces (APIs) for data exchange.

In addition, the execution of the data-sharing process might require tracking for the purposes of provenance or traceability to make the process auditable.

The data interoperability pillar consists of the following building blocks:

1. [Data Models](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071255252): capabilities to define and use shared semantics in a data space.
2. [Data Exchange](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071255453): capabilities relating to the actual exchange and sharing of data.
3. [Provenance & Traceability](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071255571): capabilities for tracking the data sharing process so it becomes traceable and can be checked for compliance purposes.

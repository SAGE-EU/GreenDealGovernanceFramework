# Contractual Framework

Within the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS), the contractual framework serves as the foundation for establishing trust and ensuring clarity in how participants interact with each other. It translates the governance principles and legal requirements into practical agreements that regulate roles, rights, and obligations. By setting common terms, conditions, and templates, the contractual framework helps participants avoid ambiguity, reduces negotiation costs, and accelerates onboarding. Ultimately, this framework provides the legal “glue” that holds the ecosystem together, enabling fair, transparent, and consistent collaboration.

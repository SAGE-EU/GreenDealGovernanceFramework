# Legal Building Blocks Introduction

The Legal Building Blocks of GDDS provide the foundation for enabling trustworthy, compliant, and scalable data sharing across diverse actors and sectors. They support the establishment of legal certainty by helping stakeholders understand and apply relevant regulatory frameworks and by structuring contractual arrangements tailored to the needs of a federated and purpose-driven data space like GDDS.

This pillar is composed of two key components:
- Regulatory Compliance, which identifies the legal triggers, obligations, and frameworks applicable to data space activities, such as GDPR, CSRD, EPBD, and other EU or national legislation,  and supports participants in addressing them proactively;
- Contractual Framework, which outlines the necessary agreements between participants, including institutional agreements (e.g. founding or accession agreements), data sharing contracts, and service-level agreements. It also highlights sector-agnostic principles such as fairness, transparency, and proportionality.

By clearly defining rights, responsibilities, liability schemes, and dispute resolution mechanisms, these building blocks help reduce transaction costs, foster legal interoperability, and create a reliable framework for sustainable data collaborations in support of Europeâ€™s Green Deal ambitions.

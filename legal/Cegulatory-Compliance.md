# Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance within the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS) ensures that all participants adhere to applicable legal frameworks and sector-specific regulations when engaging in data sharing activities. This component establishes the minimum legal safeguards necessary to operate responsibly, while also providing flexibility to adapt to evolving EU and national legislation. It addresses critical areas such as data protection (e.g. GDPR), XYZ regulations relevant to sustainability-driven data spaces. By embedding compliance requirements into the governance framework, GDDS fosters trust, protects participants, and ensures that data exchange and value-creation activities remain legally sound and aligned with the European Green Deal objectives.

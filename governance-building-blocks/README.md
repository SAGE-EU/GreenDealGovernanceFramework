# Governance Building Blocks

The Organisational Form and Governance Authority, and Participation Management building blocks are central components of good governance. They offer assistance in shaping the structure, decision-making processes, and participant engagement within data spaces.

[The ](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253671)[Organisational Form and Governance Authority](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253671) building block explores different organisational forms of a data space, the type of legal entity the data space may assume and aspects to be considered when establishing the governance framework and the data space governance authority functions, such as setting the rules of a data space, defining the governance framework, ensuring compliance, and resolving conflicts, thereby fostering trust and data quality within the data space. Additionally, this building block emphasises the importance of determining the organisational form and governance authority early in the development cycle, with flexibility for evolution over time, especially in larger data spaces or federations.

[The Participation Management](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253799)[ ](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253799)building block is designed to streamline governance processes and identify key elements for participants in data spaces. It sheds light on participant onboarding and offboarding, emphasising the risks associated with poorly managed participation, including data governance challenges and reduced collaboration. The building block highlights the need for clear rules, inclusive governance, and regulatory compliance. Key elements such as onboarding procedures, participant roles, common rules, access policies, and design decisions are crucial for efficient and secure participant engagement.

These building blocks, along with the business, legal and technical building blocks, provide a holistic framework necessary for data spaces to function efficiently and securely.

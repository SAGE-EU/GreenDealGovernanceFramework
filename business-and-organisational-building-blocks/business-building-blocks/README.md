# Business Building Blocks

The business building blocks provide guidelines to make strategic decisions. In data spaces oriented towards the public sector, these blocks can help you consider financial sustainability and the value you provide to stakeholders. In a profit-oriented endeavour, this can help you understand how to package products and services and communicate value to your customers. In all cases, they help clarify how to interact with stakeholders to make your data space viable and valuable.

At the core of this pillar is the relationship between the data products and services available via the data space you have available, the ways your [operators, intermediaries,](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253470) and customers can use those products and services, and how this fits into a financially sustainable business model. [Data space offerings](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253231) (made up of data and the requisite services) feed [use cases](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071253123), which are the foundation of your [business model](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071252828) (Figure 1).

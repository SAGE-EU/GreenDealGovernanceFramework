# Introduction

Building a successful data space requires more than just technology. The Business and Organisational Building Blocks provide the essential foundations for data spaces, covering business, governance, and legal aspects. These building blocks help data space initiatives and participants build (financially) sustainable, compliant, and value-driven systems. This section introduces the core components of these building blocks, explaining how they work together to support the creation and operation of data spaces. Readers will find practical guidance, tools, and frameworks to help them structure their data space effectively, ensuring long-term success.&#x20;

## Business Building Blocks

The Business Building Blocks are critical to ensure the market value of the data space. They are the starting point for stakeholders interested in developing a business plan for their data space. These building blocks help data space initiatives save money and add value. They also help businesses sell their products and services. At the heart of these building blocks is the relationship between the data products and services available, their utilisation by stakeholders and users, and the integration into a financially sustainable model. This includes understanding the data space offering, the packaging for use cases, and the role of intermediaries and operators who navigate regulatory requirements to add value.

## Governance Building Blocks

Governance is the backbone of any data space. It ensures transparent decision-making, enforces data-sharing agreements, and maintains trust among participants. Strong governance frameworks also help manage compliance with EU regulations, making data transactions secure and legally sound. These Governance Building Blocks gives guidance in establishing a robust organisational form and governance authority to ensure effective decision-making processes. Participation management focuses on streamlined governance processes, identifying crucial elements for participant engagement, and maintaining a data governance framework that promotes collaboration and legal adherence.

## Legal Building Blocks

Legal frameworks are essential for ensuring trust, compliance, and smooth operations within a data space. They define the rights and responsibilities of participants, structure contracts, and establish data-sharing rules. By adhering to standardised legal frameworks, data spaces can enhance data sovereignty, ensure legal interoperability and can reduce transaction costs and enable seamless cross-border collaboration. The legal building blocks highlight key legal frameworks and (non)-mandatory agreements to consider, ensuring data spaces adhere to relevant legal frameworks throughout their lifecycle. This includes guidance about the legal implications of data transactions, the roles of intermediaries, and the importance of a well-structured contractual framework that binds participants to agreed-upon rules and obligations.

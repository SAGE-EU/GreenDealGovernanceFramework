# Organisational Governance & Governance Authority

The Organisational Form and Governance Authority building block defines the structural foundation and decision-making mechanisms crucial for the effective governance and operation of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS). Drawing inspiration from established governance models such as the iSHARE Trust Framework and guided by the DSSC Blueprint, GDDS establishes a governance authority that is responsive, transparent, and representative of its participants.

Within GDDS, governance is realised through dedicated bodies such as:
*iSHARE Examples:*
1. Council of Participants: a representative assembly ensuring that the needs, contributions, and interests of all participants—ranging from SMEs and municipalities to larger enterprises and research institutions—are adequately addressed and integrated into decision-making processes.
2. Change Advisory Board: a body responsible for managing the evolution of GDDS, handling proposed changes, and ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with EU sustainability and regulatory goals.
3. Supervisory Board: responsible for oversight, compliance, and strategic guidance, reinforcing transparency and accountability in the management of GDDS.

*Other Suggestions:* 
*1. Data Space Governance Authority (DSGA) — platform steward/facilitator.
- Scope: common technology capabilities; baseline rulebook; cross-DUG coordination; conflict mediation; trust & compliance scaffolding; platform change facilitation.
- Nature: facilitator/orchestrator, not a top-down regulator.
2. Data User Groups (DUGs) — thematic ecosystems mapped to use cases or sectors (e.g., buildings, mobility, circularity).
3. Data User Group Orchestrator (DUGO) — governance lead per DUG.
- Scope: group-level policies (access conditions, quality bars, onboarding rules), approvals, group roadmaps, and day-to-day decisions within that DUG.
- Authority: primary decision authority at group level, with escalation only when cross-cutting impacts arise.
4. Participants Council (PC) — representative forum of DUGOs + key participant categories to ensure transparency and shared prioritisation.
5. Change Facilitation Board (CFB) — platform-level forum convened by DSGA to assess cross-cutting changes (standards, interfaces, credential schemes). Advisory by design; DUGOs retain authority within group scope.fulfil specific tasks.

The GDDS governance framework clearly defines participant roles, responsibilities, and policies, facilitating efficient and compliant data sharing. A dedicated Governance Authority composed of and led by GDDS participants is responsible for maintaining and operationalising this framework. Key functions include setting internal policies, managing compliance (both internally and externally, including GDPR, CSRD, and other EU regulations), conflict resolution, identity management, and continuous risk mitigation.

The organisational form chosen for GDDS, including the establishment of a standalone legal entity, ensures long-term sustainability, clarity in operational responsibilities, and flexibility to scale. As GDDS matures and expands, governance structures may evolve, incorporating additional specialised committees or working groups to address emerging needs or complexities.

Establishing the organisational form and governance authority, alongside a robust governance framework, is a critical step before GDDS becomes fully operational. This proactive approach ensures that GDDS remains agile, trusted, and aligned with its mission to support the European Green Deal through effective, secure, and sustainable data collaboration.

# Participation Management

In GDDS, Participation Management ensures that all stakeholders, from public authorities and real estate owners to service providers, data intermediaries, and consultants, can join, operate within, and disengage from the data space under clearly defined, secure, and transparent conditions. This building block defines how participants are identified, onboarded, governed, and potentially offboarded, supporting trusted collaboration across the ecosystem.

Effective participation management is critical to maintaining data quality, legal compliance, and interoperability. It helps mitigate risks such as insufficient access control, poor role definition, or fragmentation of responsibilities. Key aspects include defining participant roles and categories, outlining onboarding and offboarding procedures, establishing shared rules of engagement, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks (e.g. GDPR, CSRD, EPBD).

GDDS will explore and define a fit-for-purpose participation model that may draw upon existing frameworks, such as the iSHARE Trust Framework or similar governance toolkits, to support identity management, access governance, and operational processes like admission, withdrawal, and exclusion. These frameworks offer base-layer role definitions and credentialing mechanisms that may be adapted or extended to fit the specific needs of GDDS.

Participation Management is closely linked to other governance and operational elements, including Organisational Form & Governance Authority, the Contractual Framework, Identity & Access Management, and Intermediaries. A well-designed participation approach enables secure scaling, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures that all stakeholders, including smaller actors like SMEs or local authorities, can participate meaningfully and responsibly.

Ultimately, this building block helps GDDS remain inclusive, transparent, and adaptable, supporting its mission to deliver data-driven sustainability outcomes across sectors and borders.

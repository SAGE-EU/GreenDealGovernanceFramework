# Introduction 

â€‹Effective governance is critical to ensuring that the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS) operates transparently, securely, and in alignment with shared European Green Deal sustainability objectives. The Governance Building Blocks within GDDS serve as essential tools for shaping its organisational structure, decision-making processes, and participant engagement, fostering a robust and trusted ecosystem.

The Organisational Form and Governance Authority component guides the choice of organisational and legal forms most suitable for GDDS. It defines core governance functions, including establishing and enforcing rules, ensuring regulatory compliance, and managing conflicts. Inspired by proven frameworks such as the iSHARE Trust Framework and the DSSC Blueprint, GDDS governance structures include bodies such as EXAMPLES: the Council of Participants and the Change Advisory Board. These bodies oversee and facilitate transparent decision-making, adaptive governance processes, and compliance with EU-wide data regulations.

Participation Management is another crucial component, providing clear guidelines on managing participant engagement effectively. It details comprehensive onboarding and offboarding processes, role definitions, access policies, and common operational rules, ensuring inclusive governance and mitigating risks associated with inconsistent or poor participant management. This component emphasises clarity, consistency, and adaptability to enhance collaboration and maintain a secure, high-quality data-sharing environment.

Together, these Governance Building Blocks ensure that GDDS participants clearly understand their roles and responsibilities, contribute actively to the evolution and sustainability of the data space, and can rely on transparent processes for dispute resolution, compliance assurance, and continuous improvement. By aligning governance structures with operational realities and regulatory frameworks, GDDS builds enduring trust and maximises its positive environmental and societal impact.

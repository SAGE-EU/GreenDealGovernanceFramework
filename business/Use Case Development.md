# Use Case Development

Use cases are the anchor points of any data space, they provide a concrete reason for stakeholders to participate and collaborate. In GDDS, these use cases are closely tied to regulatory and market needs, such as:
- Automating Scope 3 emissions reporting in real estate and construction (e.g. BECO2)
- Facilitating circular procurement processes through accurate product footprint tracking
- Enabling low-carbon mobility planning by integrating traffic and emission data

Each use case should be mapped along:
- Stakeholders involved (who needs what data, and why)
- Data flows and value exchanges
- Business and sustainability outcomes
- Scalability and replicability potential

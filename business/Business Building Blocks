# Business & Organisational Building Blocks

## Business Building Blocks

The Business Building Blocks of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS) provide the strategic foundation for building a viable, scalable, and purpose-driven data space. They define the value propositions, service offerings, and economic models needed to turn data availability into tangible value for stakeholders, from real estate owners and logistics providers to COâ‚‚ consultants and municipalities.

These building blocks guide participants in understanding how value is created, distributed, and sustained through data sharing. This includes the development of financially sustainable models, the packaging and governance of data offerings, and the clear identification of roles for data providers, intermediaries, and operators.

In the GDDS context, business value extends beyond commercial gain, it also encompasses environmental and societal impacts, aligning with EU Green Deal priorities. This means supporting Biodiversity, Circularity, Climate change mitigation & Adaptation and Zero pollution. 

This section breaks down the core business design components necessary to enable trusted, interoperable, and value-driven use cases. It offers practical guidance to help participants structure their data space offering in a way that maximises stakeholder engagement and ensures long-term sustainability.

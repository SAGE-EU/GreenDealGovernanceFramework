# Intermediaries and Operators

In GDDS, intermediaries and operators play a crucial enabling role, making data accessible, trustworthy, and compliant with EU regulations. They help reduce complexity and lower barriers to entry for participants.
Key responsibilities may include:
- Identity and access management (e.g. authenticating participants, issuing credentials)
- Service brokerage (e.g. data search and matchmaking)
- Compliance assurance (e.g. ensuring data usage aligns with CSRD, EPBD, or GDPR)
- Onboarding and support for participants, especially SMEs and municipalities

Operators might include neutral industry bodies, domain-specific hubs, or trusted IT providers. In GDDS, multiple operators can coexist under federated rules, enabling sectoral specialisation while ensuring interoperability through shared frameworks (e.g. iSHARE, Gaia-X compliance).Further content will be added after co-creation sessions.

* Business Model *

A clear business model defines who benefits, how value is created, and how operations are sustained over time. In GDDS, this means clarifying:
- Value propositions for different roles (e.g. data providers, users, municipalities, consultants, real estate owners, etc.)
- Revenue mechanisms (e.g. subscription, pay-per-use, public-private funding)
- Cost structures including data curation, onboarding, and governance participation
- Incentive alignment across participants to encourage ongoing contributions

Given the public-good nature of environmental data, hybrid models may emerge, blending open access for non-commercial insights with paid tiers for premium analytical services or compliance tooling. The goal is to ensure that data sharing benefits are both equitably distributed and economically sustainable.

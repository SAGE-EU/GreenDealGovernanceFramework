# Data Space Offering

The GDDS offering comprises data assets and associated services that enable use cases. This includes:
- Data products: structured environmental, spatial, emissions, material flow, or asset-level data
- Services: access control, consent management, data quality assurance, enrichment tools, compliance reporting modules

It is essential to bundle offerings in a way that reflects user needs (e.g. emissions dashboard for real estate owners; API-based footprint verification for consultants). Packaging should also account for:
- Licensing models
- Terms of use
- User support services
- Interoperability with EU data infrastructure (e.g. Data4Sustainability, EUDR registries)

A well-structured offering enhances usability, legal certainty, and trust â€” increasing uptake and long-term engagement.
